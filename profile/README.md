# 👋 Welcome to RKHS Lab

We develop high-performance solvers for uncertainty quantification and
scientific machine learning.

🚀 Projects:
- [FastSolvers.jl](https://github.com/RKHS-Lab/FastSolvers.jl) – Collection of sub-quadratic solvers for Gaussian processes. 
- [FastQuasiNewton.jl](https://github.com/RKHS-Lab/FastQuasiNewton.jl) – Collection of fast quasi-Newton methods for convex optimization.

🧑‍💻 Contributors:
Our work is led by [Rahul Manavalan](https://dynamic-queries.github.io/).
